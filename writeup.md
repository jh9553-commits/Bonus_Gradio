This tutorial demonstrates how to build a production-ready web application using Gradio and HuggingFace Transformers. The application combines a custom image analysis tool with HuggingFace's zero-shot classification model (BART-Large-MNLI) to create a dual-interface application. BART-Large-MNLI is a sequence-to-sequence transformer model pre-trained on 1.63GB of data for natural language inference, enabling zero-shot classification without fine-tuning—simply provide an image and comma-separated candidate labels to get instant predictions. Gradio simplifies the entire process by converting Python functions into interactive web apps with a few lines of code. The app features tabbed navigation, real-time processing, and automatic deployment to a public URL that works on any device. This approach demonstrates MLOps best practices: leveraging pre-trained models from HuggingFace Hub, building user-friendly interfaces with Gradio, and deploying with minimal friction using Gradio Share.
